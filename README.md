# EdgarFundingCalculator
Persists data from selected Edgar CIK and provides an API for performing a few calculations on the persisted data.

Running this will create an artifact for the SqlLite db, if you're on windows it will go into C:/{User}/AppData/Local/

If I had to do this again:
	Import all data for selected CIKs, then perform calculations on demand.
	I'm spending too much time on database stuff
